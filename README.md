Advanced Aimbot with Reinforcement Learning and Kalman Filtering
Overview

This project is an advanced aimbot designed to enhance gameplay by predicting enemy movements and making intelligent decisions using reinforcement learning models and Kalman filters. It aims to provide human-like behavior through smooth aiming and adaptive strategies. This readme provides an overview of the key features and components used in the project.
Features
1. Player Data Structure

    PlayerData: A structure to store player data, including position (x, y, z), health, and velocity (velocity_x, velocity_y, velocity_z).

2. Reinforcement Learning Model

    MovementPredictor: A neural network model using LSTM and Attention layers to predict enemy movements.
        Model Architecture: Input layer, Bidirectional LSTM layers, Attention layer, Dense layers.
        Training: The model is trained using synthetic data to predict enemy displacement based on velocity and time steps.

3. Kalman Filter

    KalmanFilter: Used for predictive aiming by filtering noisy data and providing accurate position predictions.
        Functions: predict and update for predicting and updating the position estimates.

4. Mock Memory Reading

    read_memory: A mock function simulating reading player data from game memory for testing purposes.

5. Distance Calculation

    calculate_distance: A utility function to calculate the Euclidean distance between the player and an enemy.

6. Enemy Position Prediction

    predict_enemy_position: Combines neural network predictions with Kalman filters to predict future enemy positions.

7. Smooth Aiming

    smooth_aim: Simulates human-like aiming by smoothly adjusting the aim towards the predicted enemy position with added jitter to avoid robotic movements.

8. Spatial Hashing

    SpatialHash: An advanced 3D ray-casting function for line-of-sight checks using spatial hashing.
        Functions: insert to add objects to the spatial hash and query to check for obstacles.

9. Line-of-Sight Check

    has_line_of_sight: Determines if there are any obstacles between the player and the enemy using spatial hashing.

10. Target Selection and Aiming

    select_and_aim: Selects a target based on visibility, health, and distance, then aims at the predicted position using the neural network and Kalman filters.

11. Player State Management

    PlayerState: Defines various player states (IDLE, AIMING, SHOOTING, RELOADING, CROUCHING, HEALING, RETREATING) and simulates player behavior based on these states.

12. Player Behavior Simulation

    player_behavior: A finite state machine (FSM) that manages player behavior and transitions between different states.

13. Aimbot Execution

    advanced_aimbot: Initializes player data, trains the movement predictor, sets up Kalman filters and spatial hash, and starts the player behavior simulation in a separate thread.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Stable-Baselines3
    NumPy
    SciPy

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-aimbot.git
cd advanced-aimbot

Install the required packages:

bash

    pip install tensorflow stable-baselines3 numpy scipy

Running the Aimbot

    Run the aimbot script:

    bash

    python aimbot.py

    The aimbot will start in a separate thread, simulating player behavior and aiming at targets.

Logging

    The project uses Python's logging module to provide debugging information and track the state transitions and actions performed by the aimbot.
